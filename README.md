#Machine learning project

This repository contains a project in which I have analyzed the MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset of handwritten digits.

I trained different machine learning methods to predict digits as accurately as possible.

The project was developed on Google Colab and takes about 25 minutes to run using GPU resources.
