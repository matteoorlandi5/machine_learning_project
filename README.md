# Machine learning project

This repository contains a project in which I have analyzed the **MNIST** *(Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology)* dataset of handwritten digits.

I trained different machine learning methods to predict digits as accurately as possible.

Since the project was developed on Google Colab which provides limited resources, I have tried to select some of the more interesting methods for generating the models. The whole project takes about **25 minutes** to run using **GPU resources**. 

|Method|Accuracy|
|---|---|
|Decision Tree|0.8822|
|Random Forest|0.9712|
|Convolutional Neural Network (basic)|0.9876|
|Convolutional Neural Network (advanced)|0.9922|

The table shows the methods used with the respective accuracy values obtained.
